# Ternary Operator determines if a condition is true or false and then returns the appropriate value
# as the result. The ternary operator is useful in cases where we need to assign a value to a variable
# based on a simple condition, and we want to keep our code more concise â€” all in just one line of code.
# Syntax: true_value if condition else false_value
a = 10
b = 20
min = "a is minimum" if a < b else "b is minimum"  # python ternary operator
print(min)
